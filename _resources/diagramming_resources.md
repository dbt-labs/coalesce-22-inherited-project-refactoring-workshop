# Diagramming Resources

There are many great diagramming tools out there! All have their pros and cons, 
and your usage will depend on what you need out of it:
- **Sharing and Collaboration**:
  Who do you need to share it with? Who do you need to collaborate with?
- **Usage Frequency**:
  How many diagrams do you need to make? How often do you need to use it?
- **Budget**:
  Is it worth what you’ll get out of it?
- **Ease of Access** 
  Do you need to sign up for something, or can you start without it?
- **Visuals vs. Speed**:
  Is it quick? Is it Pretty?

There’s a lot to consider, so we’re providing you with some resources you can use 
to start exploring! All resources listed are based on the state of the tools when 
this document was created.

**[Whimsical](https://whimsical.com/)**  
This is a great tool capable of fast diagramming, sharing & collaboration, and is 
easy to learn. It also looks nice visually!

- **Need to Sign Up?**: Yes  
- **Free Tier?**: Yes - up to 3000 objects  
- **Example(s)**:  
    - [Here’s the example](https://www.notion.so/dbtlabs/WIP-Inherited-Project-Refactoring-Lesson-Plan-3bd3973c0c624badaa63baf7e8eed011#919dfe657f96474baeff9fb5e0b7ccfd) we used in the workshop - you can copy and paste this into your own Whimsical account to get started!

**[Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid.live/)**  
This is a quick diagramming tool which puts diagrams into code so it’s easily 
shareable. It’s a little bit harder to learn, but not too hard. I can be really 
tricky to get big diagrams to look right, so it’s better when you want something 
quick and easy and aren’t too concerned about how it looks visually.  
*Bonus*: If you use Notion, you can use `Mermaid` as the language in a code block
and diagram within Notion!

- **Need to Sign Up?**: No  
- **Free Tier?**: Yes, it's open-source!
- **Example(s)**:  
    - [Here’s a gist](https://gist.github.com/christineberger/44d4a1f6dfcf21e44e9eff8a8ddbeab2) with code you can copy/paste of the existing +uk_lowcost_brass_suppliers flow. 
    - [Here’s a base](https://gist.github.com/christineberger/4be30fc75dd759b1e3cc853695def798) for the workshop to get you started on your own ideas!
    - And finally, [here’s a vision](https://gist.github.com/christineberger/795e040d8a83efe86a71b4009c30decf) that Christine and Lauren brainstormed for a full project refactor!

**[Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/)**
Excalidraw is a super-fun sketchy diagramming and whiteboard tool. It’s really 
great for quick whiteboard sessions and even looks nice to present if you don’t 
need something more formal! The line tool can be a little tedious to get it looking 
just like you want, but overall it’s a great tool.

- **Need to Sign Up?**: No  
- **Free Tier?**: Yes! You only need to purchase if you need extra features
- **Example(s)**:  
    - [Here’s a link](https://excalidraw.com/#json=5Ki71CvpItc7f1HctK78v,9H7wsgfqJjRw-ST-RWum2A) to a diagram we made for the existing +uk_lowcost_brass_suppliers+ flow - you should be able to copy and paste this for your own usage!
---
**[Google Slides](https://slides.google.com/)**
Yes, you heard that right - Google slides. It’s very easy to make shapes, customize 
diagrams how you want them to look, and the way the arrows bend and move when 
rearranging things is just <insert-chef’s-kiss-emoji-here>! Plus, Google products 
are accessible to most, easy to share, and people can take your ideas and run with 
them all in the same slide deck. We love a multi-purpose tool!

- **Need to Sign Up?**: Yes, you’ll need a Google account. 
- **Free Tier?**: Yes! It’s free all the way bay bee!
- **Example(s)**:  
    - [Here’s a link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1G4fRYbBavEl9HEynl0JZzxsIDmFgf21HP3D_U3Ono8U/edit?usp=sharing) to a diagram we made for the existing +uk_lowcost_brass_suppliers+ flow - Feel free to copy this and paste it into your own slides!

## Honorable Mentions
There's so many more great tools we could use, but only a few we really considered
for this workshop as we were being mindful of goals for accessibility, shareability, 
ease of use, and visual pleasantness.

As such, we'd hate not to mention some tools that we love just as much:
- [Lucid Chart](https://www.lucidchart.com/) - We haven’t used Lucid in a long time, but it does have a plethora of objects to choose from. The library of diagramming options is really the shining aspect of using Lucid charts! It’s also very easy to share and has some presentation abilities!
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) - Figma is way more than diagramming - it also provides capabilities for UI design, presentation, and  the visuals are great. You can also create animations to explain your ideas even further - but there is a learning curve! This can be as quick or as detailed as you want.
- [Miro](https://miro.com/) - Miro is a great diagramming tool which is easy to use, share, and presentation/whiteboarding capabilities. Overall a great diagramming tool if you want quick and beautiful diagrams. 
- [Mural](https://get.mural.co/) - One of our instructional designers loves using Mural. We haven’t used it personally, but have seen a demo of it and it seems really amazing! A shining aspect of Mural is that you can set focus points on your diagrams, so that way you have an agenda for speaking about points of interest. These points exist in a sidebar, so it’s easy to click to the next idea and Mural will focus on the relevant parts for you! Pretty neat, huh?

We love a tool that will help us achieve that sparkling clean DAG!
